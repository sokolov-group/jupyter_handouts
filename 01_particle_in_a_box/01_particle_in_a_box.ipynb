    "Schrödinger attended graduate school at the University of Vienna, where in the year 1910 he obtained a Ph.D in theoretical physics. Later in 1927, Max Planck (the guy known for Planks Constant) specifically sought out Schrödinger to take over his position at the University of Berlin. However, 6 years later Hitler came to town and Schrödinger left Berlin to avoid Hitler and moved to Austria to work at the University of Graz. Sadly, Hitler 3 years after Berlin, decided to invaded Austria and as a result Schrödinger had to renounce his faculty position. But nonetheless, Schrödinger was a wanted man for his knowledge and moved to a University in Dublin, Ireland which became his last move for Universities.\n",
