    "Schrödinger attended graduate school at the University of Vienna, where in the year 1910 he obtained a Ph.D in theoretical physics. Later in 1927, Max Planck (the guy known for Planks Constant) specifically sought out Schrödinger to take over his position at the University of Berlin. However, 6 years later Hitler came to town and Schrödinger left Berlin to avoid Hitler and moved to Austria to work at the University of Graz. Sadly, Hitler 3 years after Berlin, decided to invaded Austria and as a result Schrödinger had to renounce his faculty position. But nonetheless, Schrödinger was a wanted man for his knowledge and moved to a University in Dublin, Ireland which became his last move for Universities.\n",

    "The infinite square well is an easy model. However, in our daily life, an infinite potential is almost impossible. Thus, the application of our crude model onto some realistic situation is important for a chemistry student. Here, we would introduce the finite square well. Similar to our previous case, the potential in our box is zero, but when x is outside the box, there would be a finite potential. Here we can express our new potential symbolically and graphically: <br />  \\begin{equation} V(x)=\n",

    "The potential well can be visualized as following, the wavefunction in the box was still in the form of trig function. However, there would still be wavefunction outside the box, that is <strong> even outside the box, you can still observe your particle </strong>. \n",

    "In fact, for all wavefunction with finite potential, besides the continuity of itself, its first derivative would also be continuous. If we named regions in the previous graph as region 1 (x less than $-\\frac{L}{2}$), region 2 (in the box), and region 3 (x larger than $\\frac{L}{2}$), the wavefunction and its first derivative at boundary points can be obtained with both region that boundary point defines.\n",

    "Based on the relative magnitude of kinetic energy(The energy in the box) and the potential energy, there would be two different behaviors of wavefunction. If the kinetic energy is larger than the potential energy, there would be no forbidden region, and the wavefunction would be trig function everwhere. On the other hand, if the kinetic energy is smaller than the potential energy, then the blue region would be the forbidden region, and in our classical model, particles can never beyond that barrier. In our quantum particle in the box model, the wavefunction in the forbidden region would decay exponentially, and if the energy barrier disappear somewhere, the wavefunction would back to trig function and oscillate between two values, and this phenomenon is known as tunneling"
